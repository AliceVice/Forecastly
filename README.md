Hello everyone üëã. Forecastly is a test project showcasing a SwiftUI weather application.

### The requirements
- Build an app that displays today's weather and a 7-day forecast, showing current temperature, conditions and location along with daily high/low forecasts.
- Fetch weather based on the user's current location, request permission at launch, and handle all authorization states with appropriate feedback.
- Use Swift Concurrency (async/await) for all asynchronous operations.
- Build the UI with SwiftUI using the MVVM pattern for clear separation of concerns.
- Design and layout are open-ended, as long as the functional requirements are met.

<br /><br />


# OpenMeteo API üå§
Forecastly uses the [OpenMeteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts. It provides detailed weather information such as current conditions, hourly updates, and 7-day forecasts, all in an easy-to-use JSON format ‚Äî **no API key required**.


<br /><br />

# Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### Stack:

- **SwiftUI**: For building the app‚Äôs user interface.  
- **Swift Concurrency (async/await)**: For handling asynchronous network calls and data processing.  
- **MVVM Architecture**: For clear separation of concerns and maintainable code.  
- **Core Location**: For obtaining the user‚Äôs current location and reverse‚Äëgeocoding.  
- **Open‚ÄëMeteo API**: To fetch real‚Äëtime weather data (daily, hourly, and current conditions).  
- **@Observable** / **Swift‚Äôs New Observation Model**: For state management across the app.

### Screens:
- When you open the app, you need to grant location access.
- If you have not enabled location access, you will be redirected to a view with instructions on how to do so; this view also includes a button that opens the settings.

</p>

- An error screen appears in case if there was an error while fetching the forecast.

       width="250" />
</p>

- The HomeView features a navigation bar with two buttons (‚Äúinfo button‚Äù and ‚Äúexpand button‚Äù) and a sheet view displaying a detailed forecast.
- You can expand the sheet either by using a drag gesture or by tapping the ‚Äúexpand button‚Äù in the top right corner.
- You can view all of the forecast information by scrolling through the sheet.

       width="250" />
</p>

- Tapping the ‚Äúinfo button‚Äù brings up the Overview screen, which contains links and information about the project and API.

# Notes üóíÔ∏è
- The `@Observable` mechanism works only with iOS 17, so ensure that the minimum deployment target is set to iOS 17.
- When you launch the app, you might see the following warning in the console:  
  `"CoreSVG has logged an error. Set environment variable 'CORESVG_VERBOSE' to learn more."`  
  This warning is not critical because I have applied `.symbolRenderingMode(.multicolor)` on system images, but not all of them support multicolor mode.
- You may have noticed that the bottom of the expandable sheet is bordered on the gif. This is because the screenshots were taken on the simulator, which expands the image to a square, whereas the actual simulator screen is a rounded rectangle.
